<p>Bait and switch hacking has been used for a long time. Hackers buy or get access to a site and publish pages on topics that the site itself doesn't cover. Sometimes the site owners are not even aware the pages exist.
   By making users believe they're using a legitimate program or website, hackers redirect them to a malicious
   link containing malware or a phishing landing page. Hackers also buy advertising space on websites to include malicious popups and links in things like free downloads and coupon codes.
   They make money out of affiliate fees for the clicks and from ads on the pages they use to redirect to.</P><br>

  <p>This is an example of bait and switch hacking. As you can see on the screenshot above, when a user searched "download games", a page from a site called Bitcoinspot is
  ranking in the top results on Gooogle. By purchasing this bitcoin site, the hacker has injected over 300 pages relating to gaming downloads.</p>

  <p>The hacker also injected links that only Google sees, not humans, into the home page of the site.</p>

 <p> When users click those ads or things like download buttons, they fall into trap that hackers set out. The users are taken to a specific landing page hackers created.

   <p> So here's step by step for bait and switch hacking!<br>
   1. Hacker finds a site with some outdated system (server, CMS, plugin, etc.) that gives a backdoor for the intrusion.<br>
   2. Set up the system in such a way that the site keeps serving pages normally, unless the users comes via a particular search query from a search engine.<br>
   3. Use something to fool the search engine spider when they come to index the page contents.<br>
   4. Create a series of redirects to take the user to a specific landing page (covered in ads or phishing for user information)<br>
   5. Build (buy) a massive amount of links to point towards the hacked domain to increase their authority temporarily.<br>
   6. Wait for Google to pick up the backlink signals and have the page outranking others on the search results.<br></p>
